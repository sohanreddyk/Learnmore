This repository is a curated collection of fundamental C++ programs aimed at helping students and beginners strengthen their understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It includes clean, well-documented implementations of common coding problems using C++, with a focus on recursion, arrays, number theory, and basic algorithmic logic.

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

Whether you're preparing for college lab exams, brushing up on core concepts for coding interviews, or starting your journey into competitive programming, this repository offers:

- 🔁 **Recursive Thinking** – Build problem-solving intuition through recursive solutions.
- 🔢 **Mathematical Programs** – Practice essential number-based logic like prime checks, digit sums, and Armstrong numbers.
- 📚 **C++ Foundations** – Solidify your command over C++ syntax, references, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- ⚙️ **DSA Readiness** – Set the groundwork for learning complex data structures like linked lists, trees, stacks, and graphs.

## ✨ Highlights

- Beginner-friendly code
- Step-by-step logic building
- Ideal for hands-on DSA practice in C++
- Perfect supplement for academic coursework

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any program, just compile it using a C++ compiler like `g++`:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
